Hello! This repository serves as a hub for profile themes on carrion.chat, allowing users to share easily-configurable versions of their css so that users who don't know a lot about web development are able to use them easier.

To get your templates / css added to this page, create a PR modifying manifest.json that adds in a link to your template (look at my example templates to see how to do this)

Of note: Github pages does not allow NSFW content. Please make sure all example images in your template are SFW.

Feel free to send me a dm on carrion.chat if you need assistance in getting your templates added!
