Hello! This repository serves as a hub for profile themes on carrion.chat, allowing users to share easily-configurable versions of their css so that users who don't know a lot about web development are able to use them easier.

The page can be viewed [here](https://kaylasolace.github.io/Carrion-Snippets/)

To get your templates / css added to this page, create a PR modifying manifest.json that adds in a link to your template (look at my example templates to see how to do this)

Of note: Github pages does not allow NSFW content. Please make sure all example images in your template are SFW. This requirement may change once we allow third party manifests, as they won't be hosted on github pages.

Feel free to send me us dm on carrion.chat if you need assistance in getting your templates added!
